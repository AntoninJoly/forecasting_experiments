# Time Series Forecasting Performance Analysis with Different Models and Dataset Sizes
 
In this project, we aim to explore the performance of various time series forecasting models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, and deep learning models. The goal is to analyze how changing the dataset size can impact the performance of these models. We will use GitHub markdown to document our process, results, and insights.

## Models Explored
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A classical time series forecasting model that uses the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components along with differencing to make predictions.

- SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): An extension of the ARIMA model that incorporates seasonality by adding seasonal AR and MA components.

- SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variables): A variation of SARIMA that allows the incorporation of exogenous variables, which can improve forecasting accuracy.

- Deep Learning Models: We will experiment with deep learning approaches, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, known for their effectiveness in capturing complex patterns in time series data.

## Dataset
We will use a time series dataset that represents a real-world phenomenon. The dataset may contain information such as daily stock prices, temperature records, or any other time-dependent data. The dataset will be divided into multiple segments of varying sizes to analyze the impact of dataset size on model performance.

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: We will load and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and potentially applying transformations or scaling.

- Model Implementation: For each model (ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, Deep Learning), we will implement the necessary code to train the model on different dataset sizes.

- Performance Evaluation: We will evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

- Dataset Size Variation: We will experiment with different dataset sizes by gradually increasing the training data while keeping the testing data consistent. This will help us observe how each model's performance changes with larger or smaller training datasets.

- Results and Visualization: We will present the results using plots and tables to compare the performance of different models at various dataset sizes. This will help us identify trends and patterns in terms of how each model responds to changes in data quantity.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, we anticipate gaining insights into the following:

The strengths and weaknesses of ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, and deep learning models in time series forecasting.
How each model's performance changes as the dataset size increases or decreases.
Whether certain models are more robust to changes in dataset size compared to others.
The trade-offs between model complexity, computational requirements, and forecasting accuracy.

## Conclusion
Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains. By investigating the impact of dataset size on different forecasting models, we can make informed decisions about which model to use based on the available data and the desired level of accuracy. Through this project, we aim to contribute insights into the practical application of these models in real-world scenarios with varying data availability.
